# Image Steganography

Image steganography is the act of hiding one image in another. The coding was done in matlab. 

The project aims at secure transmission of images using steganography. The
steganographic technique used here is Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Huffman
Coding. DWT is performed on cover image and Huffman coded form of secret image is
embedded in the cover image. The image is transmitted over the transmission channel
and the secret image is extracted at the receiving end. The tool used is MATLAB.
